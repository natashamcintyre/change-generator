#Change Converter
Given a number in pounds and pence, work out the most efficient way of breaking it down into notes and coins, e.g. 11.55 becomes ["£10", "£1", "50p", "5p"]

Extension Options
Write a program that takes an array of note and coin values and returns the result of summing these amounts, in £00.00 format.

Write a change generator for a different currency e.g. USD.

Turn you change converter into a cash machine, but pre-loading it with notes and change. Keep track of how much money it has dispensed, and notify the user when it runs out.
